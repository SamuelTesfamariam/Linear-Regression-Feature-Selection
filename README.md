# Linear-Regression-Feature-Selection

* In this notebook I work with data given by CodeAcademy on Tennis players. The project is originally to run simple regressions.
* However, I wanted to experiment with the machine learning technique I have learned and decided to see if I can model a multiple linear regression optimally by choosing the best features to include in the model. 
* I use the Filtering methods to select features initially. Then I turn to the Sequential Feature Selector (backwards and floating elimination). 
* I plan to work on this project further by implementing the embedded feature selecting techniques, Lasso Regression in this case.
